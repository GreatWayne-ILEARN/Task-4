##  ðŸ“…  Working with Dates and Time in Java

###  What I Did:
  I completed three date-related programs using the java.time package:

-  Month Lengths: Displayed the number of days in each month for a given year.

-  List Mondays: Listed all Mondays in a specific month of the current year.

-  Friday the 13th: Checked if a date falls on Friday the 13th.

##  Why It Matters:
  The modern Java Time API (java.time) makes date operations easier, safer, and less error-prone than older libraries.

##  What I Learned:

-  How to use LocalDate and YearMonth

-  How to work with DayOfWeek for weekday checks

-  Handling leap years and date ranges
